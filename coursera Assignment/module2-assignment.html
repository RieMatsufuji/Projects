            <p>The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally
                from India. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey
                junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).</p>

        <p>In prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds
            of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third
            most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. </p>

        <p>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or
            short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or
            imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. </p>
